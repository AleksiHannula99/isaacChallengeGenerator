# The Binding Of Isaac - Repentance challenge generator

This project is a challenge generator for the game Binding of Isaac using ReactJS and MySQL databases. This app was created by me in a few weeks as a school assignment.

This is an old project and I would do a lot of features in it differently, if I were to create this today. The focus of the course this project was created for was in its functionality rather than design or user experience.
